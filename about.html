    <div class="LongDescription">Welcome to Balmiki School, where we strive to provide a comprehensive and nurturing
      educational experience for every student.

      Established in [year], our school is named after the revered Indian sage Balmiki, who is known for his wisdom and
      teachings. We believe that education is the key to unlocking a person's full potential, and it is our mission to
      provide our students with the tools and knowledge they need to succeed in the world.

      Our dedicated and qualified teachers work closely with each student to ensure that their unique needs and learning
      styles are met. We offer a broad curriculum that includes core subjects such as math, science, and language arts,
      as well as specialized programs in areas such as music, art, and sports.

      We believe that a well-rounded education is essential for success, and we encourage our students to participate in
      extracurricular activities, volunteer opportunities, and community service projects. This not only helps our
      students develop important skills and values, but it also helps them become responsible and engaged members of
      their community.

      We also place a strong emphasis on fostering a positive and inclusive school culture. Our students come from a
      variety of backgrounds and experiences, and we celebrate this diversity and work to create a safe and respectful
      environment for all.

      We invite you to visit our school and see for yourself the wonderful things our students and staff are achieving.
      Thank you for considering Balmiki School for your child's education.

      <div class="MainTitle" style="padding-left:20px">Who is Valmiki?</div>
      <div class="LongDescription">Valmiki (/vɑːlˈmiːki/;[1] Sanskrit: वाल्मीकि, Vālmīki [ʋɑːlmiːki])[A] is celebrated as the harbinger-poet in Sanskrit literature.[2] The epic Ramayana, dated variously from the 5th century BCE[4][5] to first century BCE,[6] is attributed to him, based on the attribution in the text itself.[7] He is revered as Ādi Kavi, the first poet, author of Ramayana, the first epic poem.

        The Ramayana, originally written by Valmiki, consists of 24,000 shlokas and seven cantos (kaṇḍas).[8] The Ramayana is composed of about 480,002 words, being a quarter of the length of the full text of the Mahabharata or about four times the length of the Iliad. The Ramayana tells the story of a prince, Rama of the city of Ayodhya in the Kingdom of Kosala, whose wife Sita is abducted by Ravana, the demon-king (Rakshasa) of Lanka. Valmiki's Ramayana is dated variously from 500 BCE to 100 BCE[9] or about co-eval with early versions of the Mahabharata.[10] As with many traditional epics, it has gone through a process of interpolations and redactions, making it impossible to date accurately.
        
        British satirist Aubrey Menen says that Valmiki was "recognized as a literary genius," and thus was considered, "an outlaw," presumably because of his "philosophic scepticism,"[11] as part of an "Indian Enlightenment" period.[12] Valmiki is also quoted as being the contemporary of Rama. Menen claims Valmiki is "the first author in all history to bring himself into his own composition."[13]
